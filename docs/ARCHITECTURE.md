# AutoClip architecture

A single Python process serving a REST API and a compiled React bundle on one
port, with a pipeline that turns long video into short clips.

## Why one process

AutoClip is a local tool used by one person at a time. A queue broker, a worker
fleet, and a separate frontend server would each add an install step and a
failure mode in exchange for concurrency nobody needs. The whole thing is
`pip install autoclip && autoclip serve`.

The same reasoning drives the FIFO queue: transcription, face detection, and
encoding each want the entire GPU. Running two jobs at once on a 6 GB card makes
both slower than running them in sequence.

## Load-bearing decisions

### Word indices, not seconds

Highlight detection returns `start_word_index` / `end_word_index`. Timing is
then looked up from measured word timestamps.

Language models are unreliable at arithmetic and completely reliable at copying
a number they can see. Asking for seconds produces clips that start in the wrong
place; asking for an index the model is reading off the page does not.

### Stages are resumable because artifacts are files

Every stage writes its output to `work/{job_id}/`. A retry checks what exists and
starts at the first missing artifact. When transcription took eleven minutes and
the LLM call then hit a rate limit, that difference matters.

### Crop paths never interpolate across a cut

The reframe stage detects shots first and computes a crop path per shot. Panning
through an edit is the single most obvious sign of an auto-reframed video.

### Per-shot segments, concatenated in one filtergraph

ffmpeg filtergraphs cannot change frame size mid-stream, so a clip containing
both a wide two-shot and a tight single can't use one crop. Each shot is trimmed,
cropped independently, scaled to a common output size, and concatenated — all in
a single pass.

Panning within a segment is a piecewise-linear expression over `t` rather than a
`sendcmd` script: it stays in one filtergraph, survives seeking, and can be read
in a log when a render looks wrong.

### Filtergraph paths use bare relative names

Filter option values pass through two unescaping rounds, so a Windows drive
letter needs `C\\:`, not `C\:`. Quoting interacts badly with apostrophes.

Rather than out-escaping this, renders run with ffmpeg's working directory set to
the render workspace and reference `captions.ass` and `fonts` by bare name.
Nothing needs escaping because nothing has a special character in it. Input and
output paths stay absolute — they are ordinary argv arguments, not filtergraph
values.

### Probe capabilities, don't assume them

Two checks look redundant and are not:

- `nvidia-smi` seeing a GPU does not mean CTranslate2 can use it. Missing cuDNN
  is common, and the failure appears at first transcribe.
- `h264_nvenc` appearing in `ffmpeg -encoders` does not mean it encodes. A build
  can require a newer NVENC API than the installed driver provides, and that
  also only surfaces mid-render.

Both are probed functionally, and `autoclip doctor` reports what it actually
tried.

### Compute type follows the hardware

Pre-Volta CUDA devices have no fp16 tensor cores, so `float16` inference is no
faster than `int8_float16` and often slower. `system.py` picks by compute
capability rather than assuming "GPU means float16".

## Data model

Six tables (`db/schema.py`), migrated by SQLite's `user_version` pragma. Each
migration is append-only: once a user's database is at v3, editing migration 2
silently diverges their schema from a fresh install's.

| table        | holds                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `sources`    | ingested media and probed metadata                 |
| `jobs`       | pipeline runs, status, progress, settings snapshot |
| `transcripts`| pointer to the transcript JSON, model, diarization  |
| `clips`      | detected clips with boundaries and scores           |
| `clip_edits` | user caption edits, style, ratio                    |
| `exports`    | rendered files                                      |
| `postings`   | where a clip was posted (platform, URL, caption)    |
| `performance_snapshots` | observed views/engagement for a posting over time |

## Outcome learning

`pipeline/outcomes.py` closes the loop between what the model *guessed* and
what the audience actually did. Postings and their snapshots are user-supplied
(manual entry in the UI or CLI; nothing is scraped). Each posting's growth
curve is read at fixed checkpoints (24h / 72h / 7d) so clips posted at
different times compare fairly, and a platform's baseline is the median of that
account's own postings there — outperformance is always relative, never raw
views, because raw views measure the account as much as the clip.

Two consumers:

- **Ranking.** In `build_clips`, after the LLM's top candidates are chosen,
  empirical per-feature multipliers (caption style, duration band, platform)
  can reorder the finalists. Estimates shrink toward 1.0 with sample count, are
  clamped to [0.5, 2.0], and with no logged history the step is a no-op —
  first-run behaviour is exactly the LLM-score order. Ranking only reorders
  clips the model already qualified; it never adds or removes one.
- **Few-shot calibration.** `detection_config` injects a few of the account's
  own best and worst performers into the detection prompt as examples, so
  scoring leans toward this audience's taste rather than generic advice.

Both are behind `tracking.learn_from_outcomes` (on by default) and fail open:
any error building the model degrades to unmodified LLM-score behaviour.

## Provider abstraction

`providers/base.py` defines one Protocol. Four adapters implement it; the
OpenAI-compatible one is the widest, because a configurable `base_url` also
covers OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Together, and any local server.

The retry-with-feedback loop lives in the base class: a schema violation is
retried once with the validation error appended to the prompt. Small local
models fail the contract often enough that this converts most failures into
successes, and it costs nothing when the first response is already valid.

## Reframing: still without off-centre

The reframe controller (`reframe/smoothing.py`) trades between two failure
modes: a camera glued to the subject (constant reframing) and a camera that
parks off-centre. The lazy-follow dead-band parks aggressively, but the park is
a *settle*, not a freeze — while parked the crop eases toward the subject at
~1 px/s (`settle_tau_s`), below the threshold where it reads as motion, so the
resting frame ends on the centre line. Close-ups are tracked rather than
mean-locked (a mean-locked close-up freezes the subject's drift), and genuine
locks sit on the median observed position, which is robust to detection
outliers.

## Concurrency

The pipeline is blocking work (ffmpeg, Whisper, MediaPipe) with one async stage.
It runs in a worker thread with its own event loop, so the web server stays
responsive during a job.

That thread boundary is why the SSE broker marshals every publish through
`call_soon_threadsafe` — calling `put_nowait` on the loop's queues from a worker
thread would corrupt them.

SQLite uses WAL so the pipeline can commit progress while the UI reads.
Connections are per-thread, because `sqlite3` objects cannot be shared.

## Testing

- **Unit** — boundary refinement, ASS generation, crop-path expressions,
  provider JSON handling, escaping.
- **Render** (`-m slow`) — real ffmpeg encodes, asserting on probed output and
  frame hashes. These catch what unit tests cannot: a filtergraph that parses but
  produces the wrong thing, a font libass can't resolve, an encoder flag the
  local build rejects.
- **API** — the real app with its lifespan running, so migrations, broker
  binding, and queue startup are covered.
- **Golden** (`-m golden`) — the §6.4 reframe acceptance bar on a fixed
  three-video set. A release gate.
