"""Face observation via MediaPipe's FaceLandmarker.

Landmarks rather than plain detection boxes, for two reasons: eye positions give
the headroom rule something real to anchor to, and lip landmarks give a
mouth-aspect ratio whose variance over time is the cheapest usable
active-speaker signal.

MediaPipe 1.0 removed the legacy ``mp.solutions`` API, so this uses the Tasks
API with a downloaded model bundle.
