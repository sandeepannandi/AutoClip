"""Clip boundary refinement.

An LLM proposes a word range. Turning that into a cut that sounds deliberate
takes three passes:

1. **Sentence snap** — move the edges to sentence boundaries, so a clip never
   opens or closes mid-thought.
2. **Duration clamp** — pull the end back (or push it out) to land inside the
   configured length range, always stopping on a sentence boundary.
3. **Silence alignment** — nudge the final seconds into a measured audio trough.

Step 3 is what a fixed ±0.25s pad can't do. Padding by a constant clips breaths
and plosives, because the gap before a word varies with how the speaker breathes.
Cutting inside actual silence is where a human editor would put the blade.
